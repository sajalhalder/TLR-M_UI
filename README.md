# TLR-M_UI
In this work, we propose a multi-task, multi-head attention transformer model. The model recommends the next POIs to the target users and predicts queuing time to access the POIs simultaneously by considering user's mobility behaviors. The proposed model utilizes POIs description-based user personalised interest that can also solve the new categorical POI cold start problem. Extensive experiments on six real datasets show that the proposed models outperform the state-of-the-art baseline approaches in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score evaluation metrics. The model also predicts and minimizes the queuing time effectively.
